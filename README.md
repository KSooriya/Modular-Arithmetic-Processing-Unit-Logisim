# 🧮 Modular Arithmetic Processing Unit (MPU) — Logisim Evolution

This project was developed as part of my **Embedded Systems coursework**, focusing on the design and simulation of a **modular Arithmetic Processing Unit** using **Logisim Evolution**.  
The system models the core functionality of a simple CPU, integrating multiple arithmetic and control submodules in a hierarchical structure.

## ⚙️ Project Overview
The **Arithmetic Processing Unit (MPU)** performs basic operations such as addition, subtraction, and logical manipulation.  
It demonstrates how a processor handles instruction execution, data storage, and control signal routing at the digital logic level.

## 🧩 Submodules
The system is composed of the following submodules:
- **1-bit & 8-bit Adders** – Perform binary arithmetic operations.
- **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)** – Executes arithmetic and logical computations.
- **Logic Unit** – Manages shift and rotate operations.
- **Instruction Decoder (ID)** – Controls instruction flow and operation selection.
- **General Purpose Register (GPR)** – Temporarily stores data during execution.
- **MPU (Microprocessor Unit)** – Integrates all modules into a unified processing core handling arithmetic, control, and memory interaction.
